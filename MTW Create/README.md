Parts and accesorries for Maker's Tool Works Create 3D printer.

These are currently unfinished/unrefined.  I'm just setting up repository.

jackStand and yHolder are for working on the printer.  If you have a working 3D printer before you build the Create, these will help out a bunch.  The Y holder inserts between the pully/belt and the rear extrusion and goes around the bed to keep it from sliding back when you turn the printer on it's back to work on it.  A pair of jack stands support the vertical extrusions in the same "on it's back" orientation.  For now, I've only drawn the Y holder to fit with the heater and glass installed, but that's easy enough to edit in the scad file.

footMount and spoolHolder are specific to my shelf unit that the printer sits on.  It's pretty generic with sdjustable shelves with rails made of C-channel and 5mm rods for the surface.  Pics to follow.  These files should also be easy to modifoy for fit.
